# AutoRrgeressiveGrid
This project deals with forecasting of power generation capabilities of a Active Grid. Power generation has a temporal attribute and hence a time series prediction model is chosen as a solution to the problem in hand. Autoregressive component of ARIMA is used to forecast the next predictions.
